# TLE Object Detection :stars:

Source code for the bachelor thesis which focuses on the detection of transient luminous events (TLEs) using convolutional neural networks YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 using the Python programming language.

Transient luminous events (TLEs) are short-lived, electrically induced forms of luminous plasma occurring high above the cloud surface. In Slovakia, they are monitored by the Slovak Video Meteor Network, which currently consists of five semi-autonomous, remotely operated, All-sky Meteor Orbit System (AMOS). The aim of the bachelor thesis is to train an artificial intelligence model capable of correctly identifying the occurrence of TLE phenomena in images. This solution consists of four data augmentation methods, dataset preparation for modeling, convolutional neural network modeling in YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 versions, and final visualizations of the detected images.
